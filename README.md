# docker-nodejs-redis
This project is a skeleton for hosting a NodeJS project with redis DB. Put your project into "redis" directory.
We have a simple nodejs project that uses a redis module for communication with the redis service running on the corresponding container.
We use DockerCompose for container life cycle management.
